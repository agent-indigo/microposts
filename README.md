# MicroPosts

## Description

This is a refactoring of the MicroPosts project from Brad Traversy's 2018 Modern JavaScript from the Beginning course. I added a Bootswatch theme selector, replaced the nav with a header, and removed the footer.

## Note

This project requires the JSON-Server NPM package, which can be installed by running

### npm install

and started by running

### npm run server

Be sure to copy the contents of

### db.json.bak

into a new

### db.json

before starting the JSON server.
